Vidii
=====

A web Video API normalizer.

Vidii wraps around YouTubes, DailyMotion and Vimeo player api's and hides their api behind Vidii this is to make it easyier to embed and control multiple videos.

This was made to suit my needs on www.nyaasync.net so it may not cover all your needs, still i figured it was worth sharing :>
